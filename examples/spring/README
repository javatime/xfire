This example shows how to use XFire with Spring in a servlet container. 
You must have Maven 2.x installed to build this example.  To build type:

$ mvn install war:war

The resultant war should work in any web application. The WSDL file
for the service should be viewable at:

http://yourhost:port/CONTEXT/EchoService?wsdl

where CONTEXT is the name of the context you deployed the war into.
Since this example uses the Spring dispatching mechanism instead of
the XFireSpringServlet, you will not be able to get a list of services.
